        The Salisbury Golf Course, a 9-Hole, Par 35 Course measuring nearly 3,000 yards from the back tees, has been challenging golfers since it opened in <span itemprop="foundingDate">1983</span>. It boasts beautiful fairways, elevated greens, and a variety of tees which provide a challenge for all skill levels. We are open to the public and no tee times are necessary.

        In addition to a beautiful round of golf, visitors can also take advantage of our driving range, practice putting green, and newly renovated, full amenity clubhouse.
